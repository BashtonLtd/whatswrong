# What's wrong? #

A simple bash script to do some basic checks on the system, and 
report any problems found.  The basic concept is that this script
should be run as a first step when debugging any issue.

Please note that there are some situations where this script may cause
a system with problems to hang, for example if there are unavailable
mounted volumes
